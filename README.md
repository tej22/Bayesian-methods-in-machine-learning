    >Expectation maximization for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
    
    >Applied Variational Inference in a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architecture using Convolutional Networks
    >Implemented a basic Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate probabilities and used MCMC to perform inference using PyMC3
    >Performed regression tasks and hyperparameters optimization using Gaussian Processes.
